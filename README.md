Fluid and Air Bearings have many advantageous properties but are found mostly in expensive commercial machines.
This project aims to make fluid bearing technology more accessible by providing a place for collecting and developing inexpensive and easy to manufacture solutions for the community under open source and open hardware licenses.

The project is organized into a collection of documents of the following types:

*Experiment Document*
Contains a detailed description as well as the results of an experiment. For example if you explored a new way of attaching graphite air bearings to an aluminium body, you can share your findings in an Experiment-Document. Note that failed experiments can also provide an important contribution to the project. If you already have a good solution to a problem consider contributing a build document.

*Build Document*
A build document contains a detailed and easy to follow description of a build process and is probably one of the most important pillars of this project. For example a build document could describe the process of building a rotary fluid bearing.

*Tutorial Document*
Tutorial Documents explain basic techniques for manufacturing fluid bearings and related constructions.
Examples might be tutoials for glass cutting, graphite machining, silicone mould building ...

*Application Document*
Use an application document to presents your project using fluid bearings to inspire and motive others. For example you could show your high speed 3d-printer with air bearings, your record player with a frictionless pick-up or your precision lathe using hydrostatic linear bearings. Of course less ambitious projects are also very welcome and you may also just share your build of a simple fluid bearing

Documents are categorized into folders representing different types of fluid bearings. Feel free to explore the repository to find what you need.

# Contributing

This project would not work without people contributing their knowledge and experience to the project. Therefore your help is highly appreciated. Unexplored ideas and tasks are constantly collected in the projects wiki on the [Task page](). 

* To get started first fork the project
* Pick a document type that fits your contribution best and download the respective template from the [Templates](Templates) folder.

-Experiment
-Build
-Tutorial
-Application

* Pick a descriptive name and add the document type to the front: 'Build-Graphite_Rotary_Bearing.rtf'
* Write your document using Open Office or other compatible software. Note that currently PDF files should not be used as they are not editable.
* Generate a new folder within the project named exactly like your document and copy your document there.
* Add a preview picture (JPG approx. 500 x 500 pixel) to your document folder.
* Add the folder and its content to the git repository (your branch) and create a pull request.

The generous use of pictures in all documents is appreciated. Also make sure to provide a preview picture for each document, which is used for linking your contribution in the project wiki. Please cite external sources and honour the original authors appropriately.
